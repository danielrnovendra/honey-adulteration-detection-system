# Honey Adulteration Detection using Conductivity Measurement
A low-cost electronic sensing system to detect honey adulteration using a TDS probe, 555 astable oscillator, and Arduino Uno.  
This project implements conductivity-based measurement to estimate adulterant concentration (mineral water / corn syrup) with high accuracy.

---

## Overview
Honey adulteration is a common issue, especially with inexpensive sweeteners like corn syrup and sugar solutions. Conventional detection methods (FTIR, NMR, optical analysis) are accurate but expensive and impractical for field use.

This project provides a simpler alternative: **electrical conductivity measurement**.  
Changes in conductivity correlate strongly with the presence and concentration of adulterants.

## 📊 Results & Summary

This section summarizes the key outcomes of the conductivity-based honey adulteration detection system.  
All experimental results were obtained using the prototype consisting of a TDS probe, 555 astable oscillator, and Arduino-based frequency acquisition.

### 1. Static Characteristics

| Parameter              | Result                         | Notes |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| Conductivity Range    | **26.83 – 91.21 μS/cm**        | Based on calibration standards |
| Sensitivity           | **6.79 %/μS**                   | Indicates sensor responsiveness |
| Span                  | **64.38 μS/cm**                 | Full-scale measurable range |
| Linearity (Calibration Curve) | **y = 0.0137x + 0.4029** | R² = **0.9971** |
| Repeatability         | **0.356**                       | Across repeated measurements |

The high linearity (R² = 0.9971) confirms that conductivity correlates strongly with frequency values generated by the 555 oscillator.

### 2. Conductivity vs. Adulterant Concentration

The system was tested on:
- Pure honey (Madu Samsi, Jombang, East Java, Indonesia)
- Honey adulterated with **mineral water** (various %)
- Honey adulterated with **corn syrup** (various %)

Key findings:
- Increasing adulterant concentration caused a **consistent rise** in electrical conductivity.
- Corn syrup adulteration produced a stronger conductivity shift compared to mineral water.
- The system shows good sensitivity to small adulteration levels.

---

### 3. Adulterant Concentration Estimation

A linear model was developed to estimate adulterant concentration from measured conductivity.

**Estimation Model**

y = 0.9871x
R² = 0.9901
Error = ±4.92%

This demonstrates that the system can not only detect adulteration, but also **estimate the adulterant concentration** with high accuracy.

---

### 4. Frequency-to-Conductivity Conversion

The system converts oscillator frequency → equivalent resistance → conductivity:

R2 = (11612903.226 / frequency) - 500
EC = ((1 / R2) - (1 / RPOT)) / CellConstant
EC(μS/cm) = EC × 10⁶

Where:
- RPOT = measured potentiometer max value  
- Cell Constant (K) = 0.33 cm (from probe calibration)  

These values were derived from real measured hardware data to ensure accuracy.

### 5. Final Conclusion

- The prototype successfully detects honey adulteration using electrical conductivity.  
- The system demonstrates **high linearity**, **good repeatability**, and **low estimation error**.  
- This approach provides a **low-cost, portable, and practical** alternative to expensive laboratory tools such as FTIR or NMR.  
- Suitable for **UMKM honey producers**, **field testing**, and **research applications**.
